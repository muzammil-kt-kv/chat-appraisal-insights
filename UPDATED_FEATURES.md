  levels: {
    underperforming: { range: "< 6", description: "Underperforming" },
    needs_improvement: { range: "6.5 - 7", description: "Needs Improvement" },
    meets_expectation: { range: "7.5 - 8", description: "Meets Expectation" },
    above_expectation: { range: "8.5 - 9", description: "Above Expectation" },
    exceptional: { range: "9.5 - 10", description: "Exceptional Performance" },
  },
  categories: {
    // Detailed criteria for each competency area
  },
};
```

### Question Generation

- AI generates questions based on competency matrix
- Questions are structured and targeted
- System ensures comprehensive coverage

### Coverage Analysis

- Real-time analysis of user responses
- JSON-based structured output
- Identifies competency areas covered
- Provides explanations for each area
